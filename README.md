# Hello there!👋
I'm Vincenzo Muolo, a university student studying Informatics and Technologies for Software Production in Italy.
In addition to my studies, i'm also a web developer with a passion for building user-friendly websites and applications.

## 🔭 What you will find here
In my GitHub repository i have stored all of the projects i completed during university. I participated in each of these projects as a team member and completed my work trying a variety of contexts.

* On the <b>frontend</b> side, i have learned <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
* On the <b>backend</b>, i have learned <b>SQL</b>, <b>jQuery</b> to make custom requests and <b>PHP</b>, also using the PDO extension for security purposes.
* I've also worked with <b>Android Studio</b>.

### 🤖 Pepper Storyteller
In this university projects, we built a website and an application for Pepper, a human-scale robot that interacts with people. On web, we developed a system where both guests and registered users can read posted stories on the website, while registered users have the option to write new ones which require admin approval. These stories can be accessed through Pepper, that uses hand gestures, images, and speech to narrate the selected story.
The project webpage is currently hosted and accessible at this link  [HERE :link:](https://pepper4storytelling.altervista.org/index.php)

### 🧑‍⚕️ Pronuntia (⚙️ in progress)
In this university project, we developed a website that provides speech therapists with a platform for handling patients and therapies. The website allows therapists to manage medical history tests, create targeted therapies for individual patients, perform diagnoses, and schedule appointments. It also features a client interface for patients to interact with the therapists.
We used the Yii2 Framework for building the website, and although it is not currently hosted, i plan to upload representative GIFs at the end of the project.

## :globe_with_meridians: Portfolio 
I've also created my own portfolio, where i post the coding challenges i've completed.

I have also worked with Java to create an Android Studio app, but since the repository was originally created by my colleague, it is not currently displayed on stats API.
