<div width="50%" align="center"><h1>Hi there!ðŸ‘‹<br>Salve!</h1></div>
<p>In my GitHub repository, i have stored all of the projects i completed during my university courses. I participated in each of these projects as a team member and completed my work on time while trying to work in a variety of contexts.
<ul>On the <b>frontend</b> side, i have learned <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.</ul>
<ul>On the <b>backend</b>, i have learned <b>SQL</b>, <b>jQuery</b> to make custom requests and <b>PHP</b>, also using the PDO extension for security purposes.</ul>
<ul>I've also worked with <b>Android Studio</b>, where my assignments were to create the database, design the homepage app layout, and develop a mini-game of my own.</ul>

<p>I am currently improving my frontend skills by completing <b>Frontend Mentor</b> challenges. I have started using <b>SCSS</b>, which is a <b>CSS</b> preprocessor, and started learning the <b>BEM</b> (Block-Element-Modifier) methodology.</p>
<p>Things i want to do:</p>
<ul>I want to learn a new framework like React or Flutter.</ul>
<ul>I am also interested in learning TypeScript.</ul>
