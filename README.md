# Hello there!üëã
I'm Vincenzo Muolo, a university student studying Informatics and Technologies for Software Production in Italy.
In addition to my studies, i'm also a web developer.

## üî≠ What you will find here
In my GitHub repository i have stored all of the projects i completed during university. I participated in each of these projects as a team member and completed my work trying a variety of contexts.

* On the <b>frontend</b> side, i have learned <b>CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b>.
* On the <b>backend</b>, i have learned <b>SQL</b>, <b>jQuery</b> to make custom requests and <b>PHP</b>, also using the PDO extension for security purposes.
* I've also worked with <b>Android Studio</b>.

### ü§ñ Pepper Storyteller
In this university projects, we built a website and an application for Pepper, a human-scale robot that interacts with people. On web, we developed a system where both guests and registered users can read posted stories on the website, while registered users have the option to write new ones which require admin approval. These stories can be accessed through Pepper, that uses hand gestures, images, and speech to narrate the selected story.

The project webpage is currently hosted and accessible at this link  [HERE :link:](https://pepper4storytelling.altervista.org/index.php)


### üì± Sala Giochi
In this university project we developed an application with Android Studio consisting of a collection of mini-games. Each team member created a game and contributed to the frontend and backend implementation of the app. The app includes an online database that stores game results and displays them on a scoreboard, as well as a local database that allows for offline data storage.


### üßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Pronuntia
In this university project, we developed a website that provides speech therapists with a platform for handling patients and therapies. The website allows therapists to manage medical history tests, create targeted therapies for individual patients, perform diagnoses, and schedule appointments. It also features a client interface for patients to interact with the therapists.

We used the Yii2 Framework for building the website, and although it is not currently hosted, i plan to upload representative GIFs at the end of the project.

## :globe_with_meridians: Portfolio

## üå± Things i want to do

* I want to learn a new framework like React, Flutter or WordPress.
* I am also interested in learning TypeScript.

I have also worked with Java to create an Android Studio app, but since the repository was originally created by my colleague, it is not currently displayed on stats API.
